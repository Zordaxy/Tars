## Prerequisites

### NodeJS

Make sure you have the latest NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/.
Note: sometimes "node -v" shows 22 (latest) version. But under the hood it still can be old version. If there is error on build time, check "volta list node". If versions are different - update required, for example with "nvm use 22"

### IDE

I use "VS Code", but it is optional
Recommended extensions:

- ESLint
- Prettier

### Start project

- "git clone"
- "npm install"
- "npm run build"
- In Google Chrome go to "chrome://extensions/" -> click "Load unpacked" -> select "dist" folder in extension
- In chrome extensions Pin "Tars". Then click on it in top panel
